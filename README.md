-   Clone all the repository quoted in [Music Playing App - React and Django](https://github.com/joseaugusto0/Music-Playing-App---React-and-Django)
-   Create the virtualenv for the project proposed in this repository. Tutorial [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)
-   Install the dependencies with requirements.txt. Set your environment, and install all dependencies that you need with this command:
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
-   You need to install the node dependencies too. In *music_app/frontend*

  CLIENT_SECRET = clientSecret from Spotify API that you create
  REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:8000/spotify/redirect'
  SECRET_KEY = the Secret Key created by Django

## Project Routes
Music Playing App is composed basically by seven routes in the main API, seven routes in frontend (seven pages), and seven routes in the API to handle the spotify API. The main two ones are the API and frontend, with the respective routes:

## 1 - Main API Routes

### 1.1 - localhost:8000/room - GET
This route is just to list all rooms in the API. More for a Dev purposes.

### 1.2 - localhost:8000/create-room - POST
This route gets two parameters sent in request:
-   guest_can_pause : boolean
-   votes_to_skip : int

Just a route to create a new music room, and the two parameters are the main configs in the room. Has another one parameter, the session_id, but django create this variable automatically.

### 1.3 - localhost:8000/get-room - GET
This route gets one parameters sent in request:
-   room_code : string

This route will return a selected music room.

### 1.4 - localhost:8000/join-room - POST
This route gets one parameters sent in request:
-   room_code : string

This route will check if the room passed as parameters exists, and if it, will add in the user session the room code he enter

### 1.5 - localhost:8000/user-in-room - GET
This route gets one parameters sent in request:
-   room_code : string

This route will return the room code linked in the user session_id

### 1.6 - localhost:8000/leave-room - POST
This route will unlink the room code and the user session_id. All infos needed will are in the user session, created automatically by Django

### 1.7 - localhost:8000/update-room - PATCH
This route gets three parameters sent in request:
-   room_code : string
-   guest_can_pause : boolean
-   votes_to_skip : int

This route is just to update the music room parameters if the request came from the host of the room

## 2 - Frontend Routes

### 2.1 - localhost:8000/ - GET
This route will return the main home page if the user doesn't have a room code in his session infos. If it, will go to [localhost:8000/room/:roomCode](#24---localhost8000roomroomcode---get)
